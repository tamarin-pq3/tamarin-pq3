# Proof Methodology Case Studies

Proving iMessage PQ3 secure was far from trivial and required us to write 32 auxiliary lemmas.
To help future proof-efforts of protocols exhibiting similar challenges to iMessage PQ3, we generalized our proof strategy into a proof methodology.
We illustrate the proof methodology with three case studies, which are provided in this directory.
The proof methodology is further described in Section 5.4 and Appendix A of the scientific paper.
